    "## Value Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Value iteration is similar to policy iteration in that it is applied in a Markov Decision Process setting and follows the dynamic programming paradigm, although this time over a value space by applying a contraction operator known as the Bellman backup operator in every iterative step of the algorithm.\n",
    "It builds up on the theorem that the Bellman backup operator is a contraction operator, so applying it iteratively guarantees the convergence of the value functions to a global optimum.\n",
    "Value iteration is also rarely used in practice, since it requires full knowledge of all states and transition dynamics, which are usually not given to us.\n",
    "Nevertheless, like policy iteration this algorithm is a classic, so it is worth studying."

    "### Characteristics of Value Iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model based\n",
    "Value iteration is model based, i.e. it requires full knowledge of all states, as well as transition dynamics.\n",
    "Notice that in our case, when trying to solve the simplified Grid World, the transition dynamics are deterministic and we do not need to keep track of transition probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Finite and discrete state and action spaces\n",
    "In order for value iteration to work, the environment has to have a finite state and action space, because it saves a model of the environment internally, i.e. it saves state values in a table internally.\n",
    "The aforementioned is only possible if the state and action spaces are finite and discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dynamic programming\n",
    "Value iteration can be categorized as a case of dynamic programming optimization method.\n",
    "Dynamic programming leverages *bootstrapping* to help us get value estimates with only one backup.\n",
    "The reason we are able to backup over just one transition in dynamic programming is because we leverage the *Markovian assumption* of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Convergence Theorem\n",
    "Since Bellman optimality operator is a contraction operator, value function iteration converges to a *global optimum* of the mean-squared error (MSE) for both finite and infinite horizon settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bellman optimality backup operator\n",
    "The Bellman optimality backup operator is used during value iteration to calculate the expected future sum of rewards for a given state.\n",
    "The Bellman optimality operator updates the state value with the maximal state-action value.\n",
    "This is different from the Bellman expectation operator used in policy iteration, where the state values were weighted among the best actions of the policy.\n",
    "Nevertheless, in most cases they **deliver the same results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discount factor\n",
    "The discount factor must take a value in the range $[0...1]$.\n",
    " - setting it to $1$ means that we put as much value to future states as the current state.\n",
    " - setting it to $0$ means that we do not value future states at all, only the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initialization\n",
    "For value iteration we keep track only of state value functions in a table. State values are initialized to 0 for all states.\n"

    "\n",
    "Given a state $s$, it calculates the expected future sum of rewards for that state via the following formula:\n",

    " - $s$ - current state\n",
    " - $s_{q}$ - possible next state when action $a$ is taken in state $s$\n",
    " - $π(s, a_k)$ - probability of taking action $a_k$ in state $s$ according to policy $π$\n",
    " - $r(s, a_k)$ - reward from the environment after taking action $a_k$ in state $s$\n",
    " - $\\gamma$ - discount factor\n",

    " - $V(s_{q})$ - current value function given next state\n",
