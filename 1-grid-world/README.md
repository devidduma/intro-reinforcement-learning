## Grid World with Reinforcement Learning 
This is Grid World example that we made for simple algorithm testing purposes.

The game is simple. The red rectangle must arrive in the circle, avoiding triangle.

### Dynamic Programming
*1. Policy Iteration*

*2. Value Iteration*
    


### Reinforcement Learning Fundamental Algorithms
*3. Monte Carlo*

*4. Temporal Difference*

*5. Monte Carlo Q Evaluation*

*6. SARSA*

*7. Q Learning*



### Further Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
>we have changed Grid World so the obstacles are moving. To solve this problem, we have to use function approximator. 
We used Neural Network as function approximator
